Compiling the code:
 
g++ command is a GNU c++ compiler invocation command, which is used for preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking of source code to generate an executable file. The different “options” of g++ command allow us to stop this process at the intermediate stage.


g++ hello_World.cpp

To output the binary code in the terminal ./helloWorld

Default compiled binary file name is a.out


Commenting: 

//this is a comment

Multi line comments...

/* This is all commented.
std::cout << "hi!";
None of this is going to run! */

Re-naming compiled files:
	
	g++ hello_World.cpp -o hello.cpp

Data Types:

	int = 9
	Char = e
	string = “this is string”
	Bool = True or False
	Floats =  1.9

	Boolean	bool
	Character	char
	Integer	int
	Floating point	float
	Double floating point	double
	Valueless	void
	Wide character	wchar_t


Int score = 9

Std::cin >> score >> “What do you want the new score to be? “
std ::cout << score


Debugging:

	creating a debugging file using -ggdb flag, similar to creating the a.out but this will do both. (VS Code)
